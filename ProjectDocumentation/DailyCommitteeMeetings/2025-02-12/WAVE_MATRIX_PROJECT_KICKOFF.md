## TECHNICAL FOUNDATION ASSESSMENT

### Available Assets from Previous Project
**Wave Mathematics System**:
- ✅ WaveParameters structure
- ✅ Basic wave calculation algorithms
- ✅ Breathing animation concepts
- ✅ Unity Mathematics integration

**Unity Project Structure**:
- ✅ Clean project (Scripts folder removed)
- ✅ Assembly definitions (Core, Mathematics)
- ✅ Basic VR scene setup
- ✅ No circular dependencies

**Documentation**:
- ✅ Complete project history
- ✅ Technical decision records
- ✅ Lessons learned analysis
- ✅ Architecture guidelines

### Required New Development
**Voice Input System**: Unity Microphone API integration
**Word Bubble Factory**: Prefab creation and text rendering
**AI Prediction System**: Simulated word associations
**VR Interaction**: Controller/hand tracking integration
**Wave Matrix Positioning**: Mathematical bubble placement
**Complete Integration**: All systems working together

## IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Phase-Based Development
**Phase 1**: Core wave mathematics and bubble breathing
**Phase 2**: Voice input and bubble creation
**Phase 3**: AI prediction and positioning
**Phase 4**: VR interaction and selection
**Phase 5**: Integration and optimization

### Risk Mitigation
**Technical Risks**:
- Voice recognition complexity → Use Unity Microphone API with simple detection
- AI integration complexity → Use hardcoded word associations
- Performance issues → Regular Quest 3 testing and optimization

**Scope Risks**:
- Feature creep → Strict adherence to 10-task implementation plan
- Complexity growth → Committee approval required for any additions
- Timeline pressure → Focus on working prototype, not perfection
