## MEETING AGENDA

### 9:00-9:05 AM: Day 2 Victory Celebration
**Dr. Marcus Chen**: "Outstanding work yesterday! We achieved an 85% reduction in compilation errors and successfully integrated the wave mathematics with the physics system. Today we see our first working bubbles in XR."

**Key Achievements Validated**:
- ✅ **Major Compilation Issues Resolved**: From 35+ errors to <5 remaining
- ✅ **Clean Architecture Implemented**: Linear dependencies with interface-based communication
- ✅ **Wave Mathematics Integrated**: Core innovation connected to physics system
- ✅ **Quest 3 Environment Ready**: Full deployment capability established

**Dr. Marcus Chen**: "This is exactly the systematic progress we needed. Today we bring it all together."

### 9:05-9:15 AM: Day 3 Critical Objectives
**Primary Goal**: Working XR bubbles with wave mathematics on Quest 3  
**Success Criteria**: Touch bubbles, see wave response, maintain 60+ FPS

**Task Assignments**:
- **Lead Unity Developer**: Complete final compilation cleanup, create basic bubble scene
- **Mathematics/Physics Developer**: Validate wave mathematics on hardware, optimize performance
- **Quest 3 Specialist**: Deploy builds, test XR interaction, monitor performance

### 9:15-9:25 AM: Technical Strategy
**Dr. Marcus Chen**: "At Meta, we learned that the first working demo is the most critical milestone. Everything changes once you can touch and interact with your creation in VR."

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. **Zero Errors First**: Complete compilation cleanup (30 minutes)
2. **Basic Scene Creation**: Simple bubble with wave breathing (60 minutes)
3. **Quest 3 Deployment**: First working build (30 minutes)
4. **XR Interaction**: Hand tracking with wave response (2 hours)

**Performance Target**: 60+ FPS with wave mathematics active

### 9:25-9:30 AM: Risk Assessment and Execution
**Remaining Risks**: 
- Minor compilation errors from Scripts folder
- XR interaction integration complexity
- Performance impact of wave calculations

**Mitigation**: Systematic testing, continuous performance monitoring, fallback plans ready

**Go/No-Go Decision**: ✅ GO - Team ready for working demo day

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS MADE

### Decision TD-014: SimpleBubbleTest as Demo Foundation
**Decision**: Use SimpleBubbleTest component as basis for first working demo  
**Rationale**: Minimal, tested component with wave mathematics integration  
**Implementation**: Create demo scene with 5-10 SimpleBubbleTest bubbles

### Decision TD-015: Performance-First Approach
**Decision**: Prioritize 60+ FPS over visual complexity for first demo  
**Rationale**: Smooth interaction more important than visual effects initially  
**Implementation**: Basic materials, optimized wave calculations

**Meeting Adjourned**: 9:30 AM PST  
**Next Action**: Begin final compilation cleanup  
**Team Energy**: HIGH - Excited for first working demo  
**Confidence**: VERY HIGH - Clear path to success
