## MEETING AGENDA

### 9:00-9:05 AM: Day 1 Deliverable Review
**Dr. Marcus Chen**: "Excellent work yesterday. Let's quickly validate our deliverables before proceeding."

**Deliverable Validation**:
- ✅ **PROJECT_AUDIT_REPORT.md**: Comprehensive analysis of 56 C# files complete
- ✅ **WAVE_MATHEMATICS_DOCUMENTATION.md**: Core innovation fully documented and preserved
- ✅ **Assembly Restructure Plan**: Linear dependency structure designed
- ✅ **Quest 3 Environment**: 80% complete, finishing this morning

**Dr. Marcus Chen**: "The foundation is solid. Today we execute the cleanup and see our first working bubbles."

### 9:05-9:15 AM: Day 2 Critical Tasks
**Priority 1**: Remove duplicate Scripts folder (root cause of most errors)  
**Priority 2**: Integrate wave mathematics with physics system  
**Priority 3**: Achieve zero compilation errors  
**Priority 4**: Deploy working build to Quest 3

**Task Assignments Confirmed**:
- **Lead Unity Developer**: Assembly restructure and compilation fixes
- **Mathematics/Physics Developer**: Wave mathematics integration
- **Quest 3 Specialist**: Complete environment setup and testing

### 9:15-9:25 AM: Technical Strategy Discussion
**Dr. Marcus Chen**: "The key insight from Meta is systematic execution. We fix the architecture first, then add functionality. No shortcuts."

**Critical Decision**: Preserve wave mathematics at all costs during cleanup
**Integration Strategy**: Event-driven communication between assemblies
**Performance Target**: Maintain 60+ FPS on Quest 3 throughout integration

### 9:25-9:30 AM: Risk Assessment and Go/No-Go
**Identified Risks**: 
- Hidden dependencies in Scripts folder
- Wave mathematics integration complexity
- Quest 3 performance impact

**Mitigation**: Archive before deletion, test after each change, continuous performance monitoring

**Go/No-Go Decision**: ✅ GO - All team members confident in approach

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS MADE

### Decision TD-009: Immediate Scripts Folder Removal
**Decision**: Remove duplicate Scripts folder as first action  
**Rationale**: Root cause of majority of compilation errors  
**Risk**: Low (contents archived for safety)

### Decision TD-010: Continuous Wave Mathematics Validation
**Decision**: Test wave mathematics after every major change  
**Rationale**: Core innovation must be preserved throughout cleanup  
**Implementation**: Automated validation after each assembly change

---

**Meeting Adjourned**: 9:30 AM PST  
**Next Action**: Begin systematic cleanup execution  
**Confidence Level**: HIGH - Clear execution plan with expert guidance
