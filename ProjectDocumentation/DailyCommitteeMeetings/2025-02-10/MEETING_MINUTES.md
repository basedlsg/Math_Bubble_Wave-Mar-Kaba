# Daily Committee Meeting - February 10th, 2025
## Week 1, Day 1 - Project Kickoff

**Time**: 9:00-9:30 AM PST  
**Attendees**: Dr. Marcus Chen (Chair), Lead Unity Developer, Mathematics/Physics Developer, Quest 3 Optimization Specialist  
**Meeting Type**: Project Kickoff & Day 1 Planning

---

## MEETING AGENDA

### 9:00-9:05 AM: Project Kickoff
**Dr. Marcus Chen**: "Good morning everyone. Today we begin the focused implementation phase. Our goal is simple but critical: get XR bubbles working on Quest 3 with full wave mathematics integration. Let's review our approach."

**Key Points Established**:
- Wave mathematics are the core innovation - not optional
- Daily meetings ensure immediate problem resolution
- Meticulous documentation for future developers
- Quest 3 performance targets: 60+ FPS sustained

### 9:05-9:15 AM: Day 1 Task Assignments

**Lead Unity Developer Tasks**:
- **9:30 AM - 12:00 PM**: Complete project audit and cleanup planning
- **1:00 PM - 3:00 PM**: Begin assembly restructure (eliminate circular dependencies)
- **Deliverable**: PROJECT_AUDIT_REPORT.md with current state analysis

**Mathematics/Physics Developer Tasks**:
- **9:30 AM - 12:00 PM**: Wave mathematics preservation and documentation
- **3:00 PM - 5:00 PM**: Wave mathematics integration planning
- **Deliverable**: WAVE_MATHEMATICS_DOCUMENTATION.md with complete system overview

**Quest 3 Optimization Specialist Tasks**:
- **1:00 PM - 3:00 PM**: Quest 3 development environment setup
- **Deliverable**: Working Quest 3 build pipeline and performance baseline

### 9:15-9:25 AM: Technical Discussion

**Dr. Marcus Chen**: "The key insight from Meta Reality Labs is that we must preserve the wave mathematics while fixing the architecture. The mathematics are what make this system unique."

**Technical Priorities Established**:
1. **Assembly Structure**: Linear dependencies (Core → Mathematics → Physics → UI → Interactions)
2. **Wave Mathematics**: Preserve all existing algorithms, optimize for Quest 3
3. **Compilation**: Zero errors by end of Tuesday
4. **Performance**: Maintain mathematical accuracy while achieving 60+ FPS

**Critical Decision**: WaveParameters.cs in Mathematics assembly is single source of truth

### 9:25-9:30 AM: Documentation & Next Steps

**Documentation Requirements**:
- All decisions documented with rationale
- Technical choices explained for future developers
- Progress tracked against specific metrics
- Daily deliverables clearly defined

**Success Criteria for Day 1**:
- Complete understanding of current project state
- Wave mathematics system documented and preserved
- Assembly restructure plan finalized
- Quest 3 development environment ready

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS MADE

### Decision 1: Assembly Dependency Structure
**Decision**: Implement linear dependency hierarchy  
**Rationale**: Eliminates circular dependencies causing compilation errors  
**Implementation**: Core → Mathematics → Physics → UI → Interactions → AI

### Decision 2: Wave Mathematics Preservation
**Decision**: Keep all existing wave mathematics algorithms  
**Rationale**: Core innovation of the project, CEO explicitly emphasized importance  
**Implementation**: Mathematics assembly as authoritative location

### Decision 3: Single Source of Truth for Duplicates
**Decision**: Consolidate duplicate classes into single authoritative versions  
**Rationale**: Eliminates compilation ambiguity, reduces maintenance burden  
**Implementation**: WaveParameters in Mathematics, BubbleUIElement in UI

## RISK IDENTIFICATION

### Potential Risks for Day 1:
1. **Project Audit Complexity**: Current codebase may be more tangled than expected
2. **Wave Mathematics Dependencies**: Mathematical system may have hidden dependencies
3. **Quest 3 Setup Issues**: Hardware/software compatibility problems

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Thorough Documentation**: Document all findings, even if complex
2. **Incremental Approach**: Preserve mathematics first, then integrate
3. **Early Testing**: Test Quest 3 connection immediately

## NEXT MEETING

**Date**: February 11th, 2025  
**Time**: 9:00 AM PST  
**Special Focus**: Review Day 1 deliverables, plan assembly restructure completion  
**Expected State**: Project audit complete, wave mathematics documented, Quest 3 ready

---

## MEETING NOTES

**Dr. Marcus Chen's Key Insight**: "At Meta, we learned that complex XR systems must be built incrementally. Your wave mathematics are genuinely innovative - our job is to create the architecture that lets them shine."

**Team Commitment**: All team members committed to meticulous documentation and daily progress tracking. Everyone understands that this focused approach is critical for project success.

**CEO Guidance Reinforced**: Wave mathematics are "extremely important as that's the key of the interaction" - this guides all technical decisions.
