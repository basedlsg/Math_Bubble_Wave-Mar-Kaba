*   **Enabler for Future Features:** The proposed architectural refactor is an enabler for future feature development. A modular and maintainable codebase will make it easier to add new features and iterate on existing ones.

## 3. Risks and Concerns

*   **Timeline:** The Product Committee is concerned about the timeline for the architectural refactor. It's important that the refactor is completed in a timely manner so that feature development can resume.
*   **Resource Allocation:** The Product Committee is also concerned about the resource allocation for the refactor. It's important that the refactor does not divert resources from other important product initiatives.

## 4. Conclusion

The Product Committee supports the `Detailed_Architectural_Refactor_Plan.md` and understands that it is a necessary step in creating a high-quality product. The Product Committee's primary concern is that the refactor is completed in a timely and efficient manner, without disrupting the product roadmap.
