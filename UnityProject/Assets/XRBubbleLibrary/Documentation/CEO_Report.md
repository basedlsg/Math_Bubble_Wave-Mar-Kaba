**Subject:** A Unified Plan for the Architectural Refactor of the XRBubbleLibrary Project

---

After a thorough and collaborative review process, the Architecture, Research, and Product committees have reached a unanimous consensus on the path forward for the XRBubbleLibrary project. The `Detailed_Architectural_Refactor_Plan.md` has been approved by all committees, and we are confident that it provides a clear and actionable roadmap for resolving the project's systemic architectural issues. The plan is well-researched, evidence-based, and aligned with industry-standard best practices. It directly addresses the root causes of the project's instability and provides a solid foundation for future development.

The implementation of this plan will result in a stable, scalable, and maintainable codebase that will enable the development of a high-quality product. While the Product Committee has raised valid concerns about the timeline and resource allocation for the refactor, all committees agree that this is a necessary investment in the long-term health and success of the project. We are confident that the benefits of a stable and scalable architecture will far outweigh the short-term costs. We are ready to move forward with the implementation of this plan and are confident that it will enable us to deliver on the product vision.
